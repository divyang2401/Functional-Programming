  <th>A directed graph can be represented by a list of pairs. Every edge is represented by a pair of two elements and the whole graph by a list of edges. For example, the following graph can be represented as {(1,2),(2,3),(3,1),(2,4)}.Define a function path which takes such a graph and two nodes as input and checks whether second node is reachable from the first.
